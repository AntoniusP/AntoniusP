### Hey it's Antonius 🍡 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on research projects in automation and reinforcement learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to advance my knowledge in machine learning frameworks like pytorch and RL libraries and see what cool flashy things I can build.
- ⭐ I wonder if I'll able to bridge the gap between my hobbies and what I get paid for 😙
