### Hey it's Antonius 🍡 
- 🦀 Currently becoming a proficient rustacean doing practice and projects in Rust.
- 🔭 I’m working on projects in automation, data science, and reinforcement learning.
### Interests:
- 🌱 Using AI/ML frameworks like pytorch and RL libraries, make fun/flashy/cool tools/things.
- 🖌️ Art, Creative Coding
- 🎮 Games, Interactives, VR
- 🎵 Music 


#### My Stuff:
- Preferred Languages (in descending order): Rust, Python, C++, C#, Java, C
- Reinforcement Learning: RayRL library, Stable Baselines 3, OpenAI Gym, Unity3D, Unity ML-Agents, simulators
- General Machine Learning: Pytorch, CNNs, GANs, RNNs, LSTMs, mode collapse
- DevOps: Docker, Jira, Gitlab
- Technical Writing: Paper on CycleGANs published on SPIE, several Tech Reports
