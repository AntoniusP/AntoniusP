### Hey it's Antonius 🍡 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects in automation, data science, and reinforcement learning.
- 🌱 Trying to advance my knowledge in machine learning frameworks like pytorch and RL libraries and see what cool flashy things I can build.


#### My Stuff:
- Reinforcement Learning: RayRL library, Stable Baselines 3, OpenAI Gym, Unity3D, Unity ML-Agents, simulators
- General Machine Learning: Pytorch, CNNs, GANs, RNNs, LSTMs, mode collapse
- DevOps: Docker, Jira, Gitlab
- Technical Writing: Paper on CycleGANs published on SPIE, several Tech Reports
